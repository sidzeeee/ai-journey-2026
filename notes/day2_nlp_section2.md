## Day 1 & 2 – NLP Section 2 (Text, Files, PDFs, Regex)

### What I studied
- Reading and writing text files using Python
- File modes: read, write, append
- Extracting text from PDFs using PyPDF2
- Regular expressions for pattern matching and cleaning text

### What I understood
- NLP work starts with raw text and documents
- File handling is essential before any modeling
- PDFs are very common in real-world NLP problems
- Regex is powerful for extracting structured information

### How this will help later
- Foundation for NLP mini-projects
- Useful for document processing and OCR systems
- Helpful for text cleaning in ML pipelines
